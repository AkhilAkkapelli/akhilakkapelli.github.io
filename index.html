    <p>This is an example of embedding a video from Google Drive in an HTML website.</p>
</body>

In the code above, replace VIDEO_ID with the actual ID of the video file from your Google Drive. The video file should have the sharing settings set to "Anyone with the link can view."

Save the code in a file with an .html extension (e.g., index.html), and open it in a web browser to see the embedded video. Remember to replace VIDEO_ID with the appropriate ID of the video file from your Google Drive.

Please note that embedding videos from Google Drive might have some limitations and restrictions depending on the viewer's access and sharing settings. Make sure your video file is set to the correct sharing permissions to ensure it can be embedded and viewed properly on your website.
